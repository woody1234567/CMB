### The First Peak of the CMB

The **first acoustic peak** in the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) power spectrum provides a direct measurement of the **total matter content** (both **dark matter** and **baryonic matter**) in the universe. Here’s why:

---

### **1. Understanding the CMB Peaks**

The peaks in the CMB power spectrum arise from the **acoustic oscillations** of the primordial plasma (a mixture of photons, baryons, and dark matter) before **recombination** (when the universe became neutral and photons could travel freely).

- The **first peak** corresponds to the **largest-scale compression** of these oscillations.
- The **second peak** corresponds to the **first rarefaction** (expansion).
- The **third and higher peaks** reflect additional oscillations.

Each peak provides insights into different physical components of the universe.

### **2. The First Peak and Total Matter Density (Ωm)**

The **first peak** is determined by the **competition between gravity and radiation pressure** in the early universe:

#### **(A) Gravity (Dominated by Total Matter - Ωm)**

- The total amount of **matter (Ωm = Ωb + Ωc)** affects how strongly the primordial plasma **collapses under gravity**.
- **Higher matter density (Ωm ↑)** → **Stronger gravitational pull** → **Larger compressions** → **Higher first peak amplitude**.
- **Lower matter density (Ωm ↓)** → **Weaker gravitational pull** → **Smaller compressions** → **Lower first peak amplitude**.

#### **(B) Photon Pressure (Opposing Gravity)**

- **Photons resist gravitational collapse** by exerting outward pressure (photon-baryon fluid oscillations).
- This **push-and-pull** between **gravity and radiation pressure** sets the height and position of the first peak.

Thus, the **height of the first peak** is a direct probe of the **total matter density (Ωm)**.

### **3. How Different Matter Components Affect the First Peak**

- **Baryonic Matter (Ωb)**: Affects all peaks but is more dominant in later peaks.
- **Dark Matter (Ωc)**: Dominates gravitational collapse and influences the **first peak strongly**.
- **Total Matter (Ωm = Ωb + Ωc)**: Controls the **overall depth of gravitational wells** in which the oscillations occur.

By comparing the **observed first peak amplitude** to theoretical models with different **Ωm**, we can determine the **total matter content of the universe**.

---

### **4. Observational Evidence**

- The **Planck 2018 results** measure the first peak’s amplitude and position precisely.
- These observations suggest **Ωm ≈ 0.315**, consistent with a universe composed of **~30% total matter (dark + baryonic) and ~70% dark energy**.

### **The Second Peak of the CMB**

The **second acoustic peak** in the **CMB power spectrum** provides critical information about the **baryonic matter content (Ωb)** of the universe. Here’s why:

---

### **1. Understanding the Second Peak in the CMB**

The **peaks in the CMB power spectrum** arise from **acoustic oscillations** in the primordial photon-baryon plasma before **recombination**. These oscillations are caused by the interplay between:

- **Gravity (pulling matter inward)**
- **Photon pressure (pushing outward)**

Each peak represents different stages of these oscillations.

- **The first peak** corresponds to the **maximum compression** of the plasma under gravity.
- **The second peak** corresponds to the **first expansion** phase after compression.

---

### **2. How Baryonic Matter (Ωb) Affects the Second Peak**

Baryonic matter (protons and neutrons) plays a crucial role in determining the **height ratio of the first and second peaks**:

#### **(A) Gravitational Damping from More Baryons**

- More baryonic matter (**Ωb ↑**) makes the plasma **denser**, increasing its **inertia**.
- This **inertia resists expansion**, making it harder for the plasma to "rebound" after compression.
- As a result, the **second peak gets suppressed (lower amplitude)**.

#### **(B) Effect of Lower Baryonic Matter**

- If **Ωb is lower**, there is **less inertia**, allowing the plasma to expand more freely.
- This **raises the second peak’s amplitude**, making it **higher relative to the first peak**.

Thus, the **relative height of the first and second peaks** gives us a direct measurement of the **baryon density Ωb**.

---

### **3. How Observations Confirm Baryon Content**

- **Planck 2018 observations** precisely measure the second peak.
- Comparing the **first-to-second peak height ratio** with theoretical models shows that **Ωb ≈ 0.049** (about **5% of the total universe** is baryonic matter).
- If we artificially change Ωb in simulations, we can see how it **suppresses or enhances the second peak**.

---

### **5. Summary**

- **First Peak** → Determines **total matter (Ωm = Ωb + Ωc)**
- **Second Peak** → Determines **baryonic matter (Ωb)**
- More **Ωb** → **Lower second peak**
- Less **Ωb** → **Higher second peak**

### **The Third Peak of the CMB**

The **third acoustic peak** in the **CMB power spectrum** is particularly sensitive to the amount of **dark matter (Ωc)** in the universe. Here's why:

---

### **1. Role of Dark Matter in CMB Acoustic Oscillations**

Before recombination (when photons decoupled from matter), the universe was filled with a **hot plasma** of **baryons (normal matter), photons, and dark matter**. This plasma underwent **acoustic oscillations**, forming the **peaks and troughs** seen in the CMB power spectrum.

Dark matter influences these oscillations in two main ways:

1. **Gravitational Pull of Dark Matter**

   - Dark matter acts as a **gravitational anchor** for the photon-baryon fluid.
   - More dark matter (**Ωc↑**) → **Stronger gravitational wells** → **More compression of baryons into potential wells**.

2. **Enhancing Odd Peaks (Compression) & Suppressing Even Peaks (Expansion)**
   - The **odd peaks (1st, 3rd, etc.)** correspond to **compression** in gravitational wells.
   - The **even peaks (2nd, 4th, etc.)** correspond to **expansion** against photon pressure.

Thus, **more dark matter (Ωc)** makes the **third peak** **higher**, while **less dark matter** makes it lower.

---

### **2. How the Third Peak Relates to Dark Matter**

- The third peak is a **compression peak**, meaning it depends on **how strongly matter collapsed under gravity**.
- **If there is more dark matter (Ωc↑)**, it **increases the height of the third peak** because dark matter provides extra gravitational pull.
- **If there is less dark matter (Ωc↓)**, the third peak is **lower** because there isn’t enough gravity to enhance compression.

Thus, the **height of the third peak** tells us **how much dark matter is present** in the universe.

---

### **3. Observational Evidence**

- The **Planck 2018 data** shows that the **third peak is significantly higher than the second**, indicating the presence of **cold dark matter**.
- By comparing the **third peak height** in theoretical models with different Ωc values, scientists determined that **Ωc ≈ 0.265 (26.5% of the universe)**.
- If there were no dark matter, the **third peak would be much lower than observed**.
