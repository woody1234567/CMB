The **second acoustic peak** in the **CMB power spectrum** provides critical information about the **baryonic matter content (Ωb)** of the universe. Here’s why:

### **1. Understanding the Second Peak in the CMB**

The **peaks in the CMB power spectrum** arise from **acoustic oscillations** in the primordial photon-baryon plasma before **recombination**. These oscillations are caused by the interplay between:

- **Gravity (pulling matter inward)**
- **Photon pressure (pushing outward)**

Each peak represents different stages of these oscillations.

- **The first peak** corresponds to the **maximum compression** of the plasma under gravity.
- **The second peak** corresponds to the **first expansion** phase after compression.

### **2. How Baryonic Matter (Ωb) Affects the Second Peak**

Baryonic matter (protons and neutrons) plays a crucial role in determining the **height ratio of the first and second peaks**:

#### **(A) Gravitational Damping from More Baryons**

- More baryonic matter (**Ωb ↑**) makes the plasma **denser**, increasing its **inertia**.
- This **inertia resists expansion**, making it harder for the plasma to "rebound" after compression.
- As a result, the **second peak gets suppressed (lower amplitude)**.

#### **(B) Effect of Lower Baryonic Matter**

- If **Ωb is lower**, there is **less inertia**, allowing the plasma to expand more freely.
- This **raises the second peak’s amplitude**, making it **higher relative to the first peak**.

Thus, the **relative height of the first and second peaks** gives us a direct measurement of the **baryon density Ωb**.

### **3. How Observations Confirm Baryon Content**

- **Planck 2018 observations** precisely measure the second peak.
- Comparing the **first-to-second peak height ratio** with theoretical models shows that **Ωb ≈ 0.049** (about **5% of the total universe** is baryonic matter).
- If we artificially change Ωb in simulations, we can see how it **suppresses or enhances the second peak**.

### **5. Summary**

- **First Peak** → Determines **total matter (Ωm = Ωb + Ωc)**
- **Second Peak** → Determines **baryonic matter (Ωb)**
- More **Ωb** → **Lower second peak**
- Less **Ωb** → **Higher second peak**
