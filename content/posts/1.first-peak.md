The **first acoustic peak** in the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) power spectrum provides a direct measurement of the **total matter content** (both **dark matter** and **baryonic matter**) in the universe. Here’s why:

---

### **1. Understanding the CMB Peaks**

The peaks in the CMB power spectrum arise from the **acoustic oscillations** of the primordial plasma (a mixture of photons, baryons, and dark matter) before **recombination** (when the universe became neutral and photons could travel freely).

- The **first peak** corresponds to the **largest-scale compression** of these oscillations.
- The **second peak** corresponds to the **first rarefaction** (expansion).
- The **third and higher peaks** reflect additional oscillations.

Each peak provides insights into different physical components of the universe.

### **2. The First Peak and Total Matter Density (Ωm)**

The **first peak** is determined by the **competition between gravity and radiation pressure** in the early universe:

#### **(A) Gravity (Dominated by Total Matter - Ωm)**

- The total amount of **matter (Ωm = Ωb + Ωc)** affects how strongly the primordial plasma **collapses under gravity**.
- **Higher matter density (Ωm ↑)** → **Stronger gravitational pull** → **Larger compressions** → **Higher first peak amplitude**.
- **Lower matter density (Ωm ↓)** → **Weaker gravitational pull** → **Smaller compressions** → **Lower first peak amplitude**.

#### **(B) Photon Pressure (Opposing Gravity)**

- **Photons resist gravitational collapse** by exerting outward pressure (photon-baryon fluid oscillations).
- This **push-and-pull** between **gravity and radiation pressure** sets the height and position of the first peak.

Thus, the **height of the first peak** is a direct probe of the **total matter density (Ωm)**.

### **3. How Different Matter Components Affect the First Peak**

- **Baryonic Matter (Ωb)**: Affects all peaks but is more dominant in later peaks.
- **Dark Matter (Ωc)**: Dominates gravitational collapse and influences the **first peak strongly**.
- **Total Matter (Ωm = Ωb + Ωc)**: Controls the **overall depth of gravitational wells** in which the oscillations occur.

By comparing the **observed first peak amplitude** to theoretical models with different **Ωm**, we can determine the **total matter content of the universe**.

### **4. Observational Evidence**

- The **Planck 2018 results** measure the first peak’s amplitude and position precisely.
- These observations suggest **Ωm ≈ 0.315**, consistent with a universe composed of **~30% total matter (dark + baryonic) and ~70% dark energy**.
