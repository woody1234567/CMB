The **third acoustic peak** in the **CMB power spectrum** is particularly sensitive to the amount of **dark matter (Ωc)** in the universe. Here's why:

### **1. Role of Dark Matter in CMB Acoustic Oscillations**

Before recombination (when photons decoupled from matter), the universe was filled with a **hot plasma** of **baryons (normal matter), photons, and dark matter**. This plasma underwent **acoustic oscillations**, forming the **peaks and troughs** seen in the CMB power spectrum.

Dark matter influences these oscillations in two main ways:

1. **Gravitational Pull of Dark Matter**

   - Dark matter acts as a **gravitational anchor** for the photon-baryon fluid.
   - More dark matter (**Ωc↑**) → **Stronger gravitational wells** → **More compression of baryons into potential wells**.

2. **Enhancing Odd Peaks (Compression) & Suppressing Even Peaks (Expansion)**
   - The **odd peaks (1st, 3rd, etc.)** correspond to **compression** in gravitational wells.
   - The **even peaks (2nd, 4th, etc.)** correspond to **expansion** against photon pressure.

Thus, **more dark matter (Ωc)** makes the **third peak** **higher**, while **less dark matter** makes it lower.

### **2. How the Third Peak Relates to Dark Matter**

- The third peak is a **compression peak**, meaning it depends on **how strongly matter collapsed under gravity**.
- **If there is more dark matter (Ωc↑)**, it **increases the height of the third peak** because dark matter provides extra gravitational pull.
- **If there is less dark matter (Ωc↓)**, the third peak is **lower** because there isn’t enough gravity to enhance compression.

Thus, the **height of the third peak** tells us **how much dark matter is present** in the universe.

### **3. Observational Evidence**

- The **Planck 2018 data** shows that the **third peak is significantly higher than the second**, indicating the presence of **cold dark matter**.
- By comparing the **third peak height** in theoretical models with different Ωc values, scientists determined that **Ωc ≈ 0.265 (26.5% of the universe)**.
- If there were no dark matter, the **third peak would be much lower than observed**.
